# UWMCS API Reader

Custom UW Medicine module that is used to read provider or clinical (or any) 
data from a remote API. The basic functionality of the module is to: 
  
  1. Catch exceptions in UwmSubscriber
  2. Check if an API bio or clinic was requested  
  3. Create the bio or clinic node, if missing 
  4. To attach the API's data to nodes

The alias or URL's for clinics, bios or the remote API are defined 
in the `UwmFetcher` and `UwmCreator` code classes.
