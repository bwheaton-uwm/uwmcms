 * Theme override for Section Heading field on Sections for Medical Services
 * paragraph.
 *
 * 2019-07-17 NOTE:
 * This paragraph type is used as for sections (parents of most components) on
 * Medical Service and Medical Specialty node types. It would be desirable to
 * consolidate and use the generic Section paragraph type everywhere. However,
 * at the time of porting these pages to stevie, there was already much content
 * populated in children of these Sections for Medical Services paragraphs. Thus
 * we kept it, but aim to keep it in parity with generic Section paragraph in
 * the theme code. Hence, it simply inherits the Section paragraph's field
 * template.
